# React-Canva

React-Canva is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

This is not another renderer for React as [React Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva). 
You can use this library together with DOM (as opposed to [React Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva)).
This library takes control of the canvas in the usual form for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
